The Ontogen store adapter vocabulary defines resources for the different store adapters Ontogen supports.

Vocabulary URI: <https://w3id.org/ontogen/store/adapter#>

Recommended prefix: `oga`

For now, you can access the vocabulary in different formats:

- [N-Triples (.nt)](adapter.nt)
- [Turtle (.ttl)](adapter.ttl)
- [JSON-LD (.jsonld)](adapter.jsonld)
- [RDF/XML (.rdf)](adapter.rdf)

Note that these versions use the final hash namespace of the vocabulary.
The current Ontogen v0.1 implementation uses the obsolete slash namespace.
Ontogen v0.2 will switch to using the hash version defined here.

Check back later for a full HTML documentation of the vocabulary.
